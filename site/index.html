        This workbook and accompanying Matlab script serve to help researchers make decisions for their one-pot golden gate reactions for the production of complex CRISPR systems. The primary function of these tools is to determine overhangs which reduce the liklihood of improper binding between non-adjacent CRISPR spacers or backbone overhangs.
    </p>
    <p>
        While these tools do not minimize the liklihood of improper binding (due to the massive sample space produced by nucleotide combinatorics), they produce solutions we believe are acceptable and beneficial to researchers in the field of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.
